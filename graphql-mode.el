;;; Commentary:

;; This package implements a major mode to edit GraphQL schemas and
;; query. The basic functionality includes:
;;
;;    - Syntax highlight
;;    - Automatic indentation
;;
;; Additionally, it is able to
;;    - Sending GraphQL queries to an end-point URL
;;
;; Files with the .graphql extension are automatically opened with
;; this mode.
